## First Program

In this course, we’ll cover the basic concepts of Python, as well as build real life projects and solve different coding challenges.

let’s kick things off by creating a simple program that displays the text “ Hello World!”.

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

Note: The print statement is always followed by parentheses containing the output we want to generate.

## Printing Text

The text in the print statement needs to be enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes. 

```python
print("Python is cool")
```

Note: The quotes enclosing the text need to be the same, either both single quotes or both double.

---

Note that the print statement encloses the text we want to output in parentheses. 

```python
print("Welcome")
```

Always remember to close the opened parenthesis — without it the print statement will not work.

---

You can use multiple print statements in you code. Each print statement outputs text from a new line.

```python
print("Akash")
print("Sonia")
print("Abhishek")
print("Sachin")
```

Python code contains lots of references to Monty Python. So you will see “spam” and “eggs” often used as placeholder variables.

---

## Printing Numbers

You can output numbers without the quotes.

```python
print(42)
```

The number 42 us, in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the “answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything’, calculated by a big computer over a period of 7.5 million years.

## Print

Awesome! Now you know how to output text and numbers!

Remember the following important points:

- the print statement needs to be followed by parentheses, enclosing the output we want to generate.
- text needs to be enclosed in quotes. - either single quotes or double quotes.
- numbers can be output without using quotes.

## Practice makes perfect

Use our code coach exercises below to practice and write real code.

The first exercise is easier, so start with that one, and then try the more complex one.

---

### #Test1: Your First Program:

Let’s code for real!

The given program should output the text: 

“Python is awesome!” 

But something goes wrong.

### Task: Fix the program to generate the required output.

```python
print("Python is awesome")
```

output: Python is awesome!

### #Test2: Multiple Lines

Create a program to output the numbers 1, 2 and 3, each on a separate line.

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
```

Recall that each print statement outputs from a new line.

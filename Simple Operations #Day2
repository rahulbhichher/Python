So Python can spell, but can it count? Let’s talk about calculations.

Doing a calculation in Python is simple, just enter it into the print statement.

```python
print(2 + 3)
print(5 + 4 - 3)
```

See the spaces around the plus and minus signs? The code will work without them - but including them makes it a lot easier to read.

---

Multiplication can be done using *(asterisk) and division can be done using / (slash) sign. 

---

```python
print(5 * 5) #multiplication 
print(5 / 5) #Division
```

Using a single slash to divide numbers always produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming), even if the result is a whole number.

---

## Let’s do some more complicated mathematical operations:

Just like in regular math, we can use parentheses to indicate the operations we want performed first, like this:

```python
print(2 * (3 +4))
```

Note: Make sure to close all parentheses. 

---

Division results in a decimal. 

What is the output of this code?

```python
print((4 + 8) / 2)
```

6.0

---

## Negative Numbers:

You can use the minus sign in front of a number to make it negative.

```python
print(-8 * 6)
```

For example: 

```python
print((-5 - 1) * 3)
# -18
```

## Big Calculations:

One of the things that is great about Python is that it can perform operations with really big numbers.

For example, let’s calculate 123456789 times 12345:

```python
print(123456789 * 12345)
# Output: 1524074060205
```

## Time to practice:

1. Simple Calculation:
    1. You need to calculate the points earned by a soccer team. The team won 18 games and ended 7 games as a draw. A win brings 3 points, while a draw brings 1.
    
    Create a program to calculate and output the total points earned by the team.
    
    ```python
    print(18 * 3 + (7 * 1))
    ```
    
2. Ever wondered how many seconds there are in a month? (30 days)
    
    write a program to calculate and output the answer.
    
    Remember, there are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute.
    
    Use  the print() statement to output the result.
    
    ```python
    print(((60 * 60) * 24) * 30)
    ```

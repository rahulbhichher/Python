## Newlines

The backslash is also used to create new lines in text. 

To create a new line we use \n.

```python
print('One \nTwo \nThree')
```

## Tab

Similar to a new line, we can create a tab using \t

```python
print("\t hey \t there")
```

## Carriage Return

\r is the carriage return symbol:

```python
print("Hi \r there")
```

\r is used to shift the cursor to the beginning of the line, however it might not work as expected in all python environments.

## Escaping

What if we need to include the special character in our output? For example, what if we want to have \n in the output.

In that case, we simply need yo escape it using another backslash

```python
print("Newline is \\n")
```

> Which of the following statements will output “\r\n”?
> 

```python
print("\\r\\n")
```

## \n vs \r

What is the difference between \n and \r?

\n is the newline character, while \r is the carriage return. They differ in what uses [them. Windows](http://them.Windows) uses \r\n to signify the enter key passed, while Linux and Unix use \n.

\n is useful, but it can be cumbersome if we’re tryinf to format lots of multiline text.

There’s another way though! Newlines are automatically added for strings created using three quotes. 

```python
print("""This
is a 
multiline
text""")
```

This makes it easier to format long, multi-line texts without  the need to explicitly put \n for line breaks.

## Three quotes

When you use three quotes to create text, quotes do not need to be escaped:

For example:

```python
print('''
I'm learning.
python's syntax is easy.
''')
```

### Task1. Write a program to output the letters A B C F, each on a separate line.

```python
print('''
A
B
C
D''')
```

### Task2. This code tries to make a triangle out of stars. There’s an error in there somewhere- it outputs all the stars on one line, instead of separate lines.

Fix the code to output a triangle of stars that has 4 rows.

# Exponentiation

Two asterisks ** are used to raise a number to the power of another, which is called **exponentiation**.

```python
print(2 ** 5)
```

---

You can chain exponentiations together.

In other words, you can raise a number to a power, which can also be raised to a power.

```python
print(2**3**2)
```

---

We can also use floats in exponentiation.

Check it out. The following code will result in the square root of 9:

```python
print(9 ** (1/2)) #output: 3.0
```

The result will be in float.

## Floor Division

As we have seen, dividing two numbers always produces a float.

In case we want to find the quantity produced by the division  of two numbers as an integer(also called the quotient), we can use the floor division operator // 

```python
print(20 // 6) #output: 3
```

The code above will output 3, because 6 goes into 20 three times.

## Remainder

If we want to find only the remainder in a division, we use the modulo operator %

```python
print(20 % 6) #output: 2
```

Practice Task: Change the code to output the remainder of 1024 divided by 42.

#output: 16

### Exercise:

```python
print(7 % (5 // 2)) #output: 1
```

---

## Quotient and Remainder

We can also use the floor division and modulo operators with floats.

```python
print(1.25 % 0.5) #output: 0.25
print(4.2 // 1.4) #output: 3.0
```

Question: What is the operator used to determine the remainder of a division?

%

### Task1: Exponentiation

Write code to output 4 raised to the 5th power

```python
print(4 ** 5) #output: 1024
```

### Task2:  Growing Bacteria

Did you know that there are more bacteria cells in your body than cells that make up your body?

Weird!

A bacteria culture starts with 500 bacteria and doubles in size every hour.

Which means that after 1 hour the number of bacteria is 1000, after 2 hours, 2000, and so on.

Calculate and output the number of bacteria that will be in the culture after 24 hours.

Note: The formula to calculate the bacteria after N hours will be: 500*2**á´º**

```python
print(500*2**24) #output: 8388608000
```

### Task3: Number of Hours

Random task! You need to calculate the number of hours in 888 minutes.

Your program needs to output the number of the hours and then the number of remaining  minutes, on separate lines.

For example, 72 minutes are to 1 hour and 12 minutes, so your program would outpur:

```python
1
12
```

Note: You can use the floor division to find the number of hours, and the modulo operator to find the remaining minutes. Use separate print() statements for each output.

 

```python
print(888 // 60)
print(888 % 60)
```

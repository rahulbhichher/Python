Before continuing, it’s a good idea to introduce the main types that we use in Python. 

**Each value in Python has a type.**

Text in quotes, no matter single or double, like “Hello World” is called a **string.**

Note: As we have seen, we can use single or double quotes to create strings.

## Integers

Whole numbers are called integers.

We can output integers with the print statement.

```python
print(42)
```

Integers don't require to be enclosed in quotes.

---

You can add, subtract and multiply integers, producing another integer as a result.

Some examples:

```python
print(10 - 6 + 22) 
print(125 * 300)
```

Note: If you have a python IDE Installed on your Lappy, try  multiplying 42  by 77 and comment the cmd used with resulting integer.

## Floats

Do you know that dividing two integers produces a decimal? yeah, and that is called a float.

```python
print(6 / 2) #output: 3.0
print(8 / 3) #output: 2.66666665
```

As you can see, the output is 3.0, not 3 and so on...

So we can say that, the result of division is always a float, even if those with no remainders.

---

You can perform mathematical operations with floats, just like the integers:

```python
print(2.16 * 8)
print(5.6 - 2.6)
print(9.4 + 0.6)
```

Important: When we add an integer (2) to a float (2.0), the result is always a float i.e. 

```python
print(2 + 2.0) #output: 4.0
```

## Let’s summarize what Data Types are in Python:

1. Integers are whole numbers, such as 10 and 32
2. Floats are numbers with a decimal point, like 3.23
3. Strings are text enclosed in single or double quotes. 

Note: Dividing with a slash produces a float, even if you divide whole numbers.

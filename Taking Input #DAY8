### Input

Some programs need to take input from the user.

For example, a game can ask for the user’s name and age as input and then use them in the game.

The input() function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string. Like this:

```python
x = input()
print(x)
```

---

```python
text = input()
print(text)
```

---

Even if the user enters a number as input, it’s processed as a string

```python
x = input()
print("You entered: " + x)
```

---

> input() produces a string
> 

---

The input statement needs to be followed by parentheses.

```python
name = input()
print("welcome, " + name)
```

---

You can provide a string to input() between the parentheses, producing a prompt message.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

The prompt message tells the user what input the program is requesting - so its important to make sure it’s clear.

## Task1: Desired Output

Somebody wrote code to take a string input and output it, repeated 10 times. However, the code results in an error.

Fix the code to output the desired output.

```python
x = input()
print(x * 10)
```

## Task2: Get Notified!

You’re working on a notification system and need to make the notification text eye-catching.

Write a program that takes the text as input and outputs it by adding 3 starts at the beginning and at the end.

```python
x = input()
print("*** " + x + " ***")

```

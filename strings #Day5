We met with strings on Day 1, but now it’s time to get better acquainted.

Remember, we can create a string by entering text between two single or double quotation marks. Like this.

```python
print("Python is fun")
print('Always look on the bright side of life')
```

Note: The delimiter (” or ‘) used for a string doesn’t affect how it behaves in any way. 

---

```python
print('Hi There')
```

---

Everything in quotes is a string, even number:

```python
print('42')
```

In the code above, 42 is a string, not an integer.

---

## Backslash

In python, the backslash \ is a special character, called the escape character.

It is used to represent certain things in a string, such as new lines, tabs, and other useful things.

---

If you want to include a quote in a string, you need to escape it using a backslash. 

For example: 

```python
print('Rahul\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!')
```

Note: Backslashes that we use for escaping don’t get displayed in the output.

---

You can do the same for double quotes. 

For example:

```python
print("He said: \"Cool!\".")
```

---

## Time to Practice

### Output The String:

You are given a code that should output a string with quotes. However, it contains errors.

### Task1: Fix the given code to generate the expected output.

```python
print('I'm learning Python. It's easy.')
```

```python
print('I\'m learning Python. It\'s easy.')
```

### Words of Wisdom:

The man, the legend, Steve Jobs said a lot of cool stuff. Write a program to output his most famous quote in the following format:

“Stay hungry, stay foolish” by Steve Jobs

The output needs to include the double quotes and be exactly in the format shown above.

```python
print("\"Stay hungry, stay foolish\" by Steve Jobs")
```
